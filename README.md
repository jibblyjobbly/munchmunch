### You are what you eat! See your hunger bar change to the food you're enjoying - delicious! ðŸ˜‹

A mod for anyone who wants to take personalisation of their Minecraft experience to the next level.

Once installed, this mod will make your hunger bar adapt to the food you eat.

**Top features include:**
 - Reactive animations based on what you're eating and how much you're enjoying it
- For any additional foods you've added, new hunger bar textures can be applied simply through a resource pack

If you have any issues, feature requests or anything else please feel free to submit them on the GitHub.


Munch Munch allows for easily adding new textures for foods added by other mods. If you want your mod to support Munch Munch textures, you will need six 9x9 textures for:
 - `<food_id>_full.png`
 - `<food_id>_half.png`
 - `<food_id>_empty.png`
 - `<food_id>_full_hunger.png`
 - `<food_id>_half_hunger.png`
 - `<food_id>_empty_hunger.png`

These files should be located in `assets/<mod_namespace>/textures/gui/sprites/hunger/<food_id>/`.

If you want to add new animations to expand on the default ones, there is a simple API allowing you to do so. The first thing necessary is to add Munch Munch as a dependency to your mod.

`build.gradle`
```
repositories {
  maven {
    url = "https://api.modrinth.com/maven/"
  }
}

dependencies {
  modImplementation "maven.modrinth:munchmunch:${project.munchmunch_version}"
}
```
`gradle.properies`
```
munchmunch_version=0.1.0
```
Now that Munch Munch works, the way to add new animations is simple. First we will create our animation:

```
public class ExampleAnimation implements HungerAnimation {
  @Override
  public HungerState getState() {
    return HungerState.IDLE; // This will constantly run until HungerState is changed
  }

  @Override
  public Vector2f offset(int slot, float time) {
    return new Vector2f(0f, 1f); // Translate all icons 1px down
  }

  @Override
  public Vector2f scale(int slot, float time) {
    return new Vector2f(1f, 1f); // Leave scale as default for now
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isFinished() { return true; } // An idle animation can be overriden whenever necessary

  @Override
  public boolean isTimed() { return false; } // This is for an animation that only lasts for a certain amount of time
}
```

This is a simple example of what an animation you make could look like. All that is needed to register this animation is the entrypoint.

```
public class ModAnimationEntrypoint implements AnimationEntrypoint {
  @Override
  public void registerAnimations() {
    AnimationRegistry.register(ExampleAnimation::new);
  }
}
```

Then in your `fabric.mod.json`:
```
{
  entrypoints: {
    "munchmunch": [
      "com.munchmunch.examplemod.ModAnimationEntrypoint"
    ]
  }
}
```

If your animation needs to run at a different time than the built in `IDLE` and `GAIN` (gain hunger) states, a new `HungerState` can be added simply with:

```
public class ExampleMod implements ClientModInitializer {
  public static final HungerState CUSTOM_STATE = register(Identifier.of("examplemod_id", "custom_state"));
}
```

To make this custom `HungerState` be used, it is necessary to call `AnimationSelector.getInstance().setState(HungerState.CUSTOM_STATE)` which will play a random animation from all available animations with the `HungerState` of `CUSTOM_STATE` until they are finished. If they do not end, you will have to add another `AnimationSelector.getInstance().setState()` but this time set it back to `HungerState.IDLE` when you want your animation to stop. Otherwise just use the `IDLE` animation.
